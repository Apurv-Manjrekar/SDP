# CSE Team 49 Senior Design Project: Applying Differential Privacy to Sensitive Vehicle Telematics
---
## Project Description
---
This project explored the research, development, and real-world demonstration of Differential Privacy (DP) as a foundational method for privacy-preserving analytics in the insurance industry. As companies increasingly rely on sensitive data such as vehicle telematics, location tracking, and personally identifiable information, they face the challenge of gaining meaningful insights while preserving the privacy of individuals. Working with The Hartford, our objective was to investigate the capabilities of Differential Privacy and to build a prototype system that brings the concept into practice. 

The project began with an extensive research phase covering the core mathematical principles of Differential Privacy, as well as the privacy-utility trade-offs involved in its practical implementation. We analyzed the state of existing tools, frameworks, and datasets, and compared multiple approaches to privacy-preserving data analysis. OpenDPâ€™s PyDP library was selected as the foundation for our prototype due to its alignment with formal privacy guarantees and strong community support. Our research also included evaluating the implications of DP in regulated environments, particularly in insurance applications such as risk assessment, fraud detection, and policy pricing. It was chosen that insurance safe driving application which track user vehicle telematics data could be a valuable demonstration of DP. 

To simulate real-world data, we used SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) to generate a synthetic vehicle telematics dataset that mimicked common usage patterns in insurance scenarios. We applied Differential Privacy mechanisms to this dataset using PyDP, adding controlled noise to individual data points while preserving the statistical utility of the data. We then computed risk scores for each simulated vehicle, both before and after applying Differential Privacy, and conducted an analysis to evaluate the impact of privacy-preserving techniques on the results. The effects were visualized using heatmaps and comparative graphics, allowing us to assess how privacy influenced decision-making outputs. 

A significant component of our work was the development of an interactive website designed to make Differential Privacy accessible and engaging for a broader audience. This platform enables users to explore the synthetic dataset, simulate their own vehicle trips, view differentially private outputs in comparison to raw data, and gain an intuitive understanding of how Differential Privacy works and why it matters. The website also serves as an educational resource, explaining core concepts, practical challenges, and the broader ethical and societal considerations of privacy in data-driven environments. 

Ultimately, our project delivers a robust combination of research, engineering, and public education. We produced a detailed literature review, comparative tool analysis, a functioning prototype that integrates SUMO and PyDP, and a full-featured website that demonstrates the real-world value of Differential Privacy. By integrating academic rigor with accessible design, our work provides a practical roadmap for implementing privacy-preserving data analytics in the insurance industry and beyond.
